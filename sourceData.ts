PREFACE: The Einstein of Library Science
Before S.R. Ranganathan, a library was seen as a storehouse, and a librarian was seen as a guard. Ranganathan changed this forever. He viewed the library as a "growing organism" and the librarian as a scientist.
A mathematician by training, he applied logic and scientific formulas to the organization of knowledge. His inventions, such as the Colon Classification and the Five Laws of Library Science, are still the bedrock of how we organize information today, from physical bookshelves to digital databases. This is the story of how a boy from a small South Indian village became a National Research Professor and a global legend.

CHAPTER 1: ROOTS
The Mathematician from Shiyali (1892–1923)
Birth and Background
Shiyali Ramamrita Ranganathan was born on August 9, 1892, in the town of Shiyali (now Sirkazhi) in the Tanjore district of Tamil Nadu. He came from a traditional Brahmin family. His father, N. Ramamrita Ayyar, was a cultured landlord who passed away suddenly when Ranganathan was only six years old. Ranganathan was raised by his mother, Seethalakshmi, and his grandfather, who instilled in him values of discipline and religious devotion.

Education
Despite suffering from stammering and poor health in his youth, Ranganathan was a brilliant student.
● He moved to Madras (Chennai) for higher studies in 1909.
● He attended the prestigious Madras Christian College (MCC), earning his B.A. (1913) and M.A. (1916) in Mathematics.
● In 1917, he obtained a teaching degree (L.T.) from Teachers’ College, Saidapet.

The Professor of Mathematics
Before libraries entered his mind, Ranganathan was deeply in love with Mathematics. From 1917 to 1923, he taught at:
1. Government College, Mangalore
2. Government College, Coimbatore
3. Presidency College, Madras
He was a strict but popular teacher. He published papers on the history of mathematics and believed that teaching was his life's purpose. He had no intention of leaving this profession.

CHAPTER 2: THE ACCIDENTAL LIBRARIAN
(1924)
The Vacancy
In 1923, the University of Madras created a new position: University Librarian. Ranganathan’s colleagues urged him to apply. He was hesitant; he loved teaching math and knew nothing about libraries. However, the librarian post offered a higher salary, so he applied.
Because of his strong research background, he was selected from 900 candidates. He assumed office in January 1924.

The Struggle
Ranganathan hated the job immediately. The library was dusty, disorganized, and lonely. He missed his students. Within weeks, he went to the University administration to resign and ask for his teaching job back.
The administration made him a deal: "Go to London to study modern library methods. If you return and still hate the job, you can go back to teaching mathematics."
Ranganathan agreed. This decision changed history.

CHAPTER 3: THE LONDON EPIPHANY
A Science is Born (1924–1925)
In September 1924, Ranganathan arrived at the University College London (UCL).

The Mentor
He studied under W.C. Berwick Sayers, a famous librarian. Sayers noticed that Ranganathan thought like a mathematician. He encouraged Ranganathan to look at the theory behind organizing books, not just the practice.

The Meccano Set Inspiration
At that time, the world used the Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC). This system assigned fixed numbers to subjects. Ranganathan felt this was too rigid for new, emerging subjects.
One day, while visiting a toy shop in London, Ranganathan saw a Meccano set (a toy construction kit with nuts, bolts, and metal strips).
● He realized: A classification system should be like a Meccano set.
● Instead of giving a fixed number, the librarian should have "standard pieces" (like Time, Space, Energy) and connect them with bolts (symbols like colons) to build a number for any subject.
This idea became the Colon Classification, a system that could handle any new knowledge.

The Service Spirit
Ranganathan visited over 100 libraries in the UK. He was amazed by how they served the poor, the workers, and the children. He realized that a library was a social institution. He returned to India in 1925 with a mission: To combine Western service spirit with Indian intellectual logic.

CHAPTER 4: THE MADRAS LABORATORY
Revolutionizing the Library (1925–1944)
Back in Madras, Ranganathan worked with the energy of a man possessed. He worked 13 hours a day, 7 days a week, often sleeping in the library.

Open Access System
In those days, books were kept in locked cupboards. Ranganathan removed the locks. He introduced "Open Access," allowing readers to walk to the shelves and browse freely. This was a radical move in India.

Library Education
He realized India needed trained librarians.
● In 1928, he founded the Madras Library Association (MALA).
● In 1929, he started a Certificate Course in Library Science.
● By 1937, this became a postgraduate Diploma at the University of Madras.
During these years, he wrote his most famous books and turned the Madras University Library into a model for the rest of Asia.

CHAPTER 5: THE FIVE LAWS & CLASSIFICATION
The Intellectual Foundation
Ranganathan gave the world two major gifts during his time in Madras.

1. The Five Laws of Library Science (1931)
He summarized the entire philosophy of libraries into five simple statements:
1. Books are for use. (Do not just lock them up).
2. Every reader his/her book. (Libraries are for everyone, rich or poor).
3. Every book its reader. (Proper cataloging helps a book find the right person).
4. Save the time of the reader. (Organization must be efficient).
5. The Library is a growing organism. (Libraries will always expand and change).

2. Colon Classification (1933)
This was his revolutionary system. He broke all knowledge down into five "Facets" (PMEST):
● Personality (The core subject)
● Matter (Materials)
● Energy (Action or problem)
● Space (Geographic location)
● Time (Historical period)
By combining these, a librarian could create a unique code for even the most specific document.

CHAPTER 6: BUILDING A NATION
Banaras, Delhi, and Legislation (1945–1955)
Ranganathan retired from Madras University in 1944, but his work was far from done.

Banaras Hindu University (1945–1947)
Invited by Madan Mohan Malaviya, Ranganathan modernized the BHU library. In just two years, he personally classified over 100,000 books, working tirelessly.

University of Delhi (1947–1955)
Sir Maurice Gwyer, Vice-Chancellor of Delhi University, invited him to start a Department of Library Science.
● Ranganathan launched the Master’s degree (M.Lib.Sc) and Ph.D. program, the first in the Commonwealth.
● He drafted the Library Development Plan for independent India.

Library Legislation
Ranganathan believed that libraries should be supported by law and taxes. He fought for years to get laws passed.
● His efforts resulted in the Madras Public Libraries Act of 1948.
● This was the first library law in India and set the standard for other states.

CHAPTER 7: THE GLOBAL ICON
Zurich to Bangalore (1954–1972)

International Fame
By the 1950s, the West recognized Ranganathan's genius. He served as a key member of the International Federation for Information and Documentation (FID). From 1954 to 1957, he lived in Zurich, Switzerland, writing and lecturing to international audiences.

Documentation Research and Training Centre (DRTC)
He returned to India and settled in Bangalore. In 1962, he founded the DRTC. This institute focused on advanced research in information science and automation. It remains a premier institute today.

National Research Professor (1965)
The Government of India honoured him with the title of National Research Professor. He was one of only five people in India to hold this title at the time, placing him in the same league as Nobel Prize winner C.V. Raman.

CHAPTER 8: PERSONAL LIFE
The Karma Yogi

Family
Ranganathan married Rukmini in 1907. She was a devoted wife but passed away in a tragic drowning accident in 1928. In 1929, he married Sarada, who became his pillar of strength. She managed the household completely, allowing him to focus entirely on his work. They had one son, R. Yogeshwar.

Character
Ranganathan lived a simple, Gandhian life.
● He ate only one meal a day for many years.
● He walked barefoot in the library.
● He did not care for money. He donated his entire life savings (approx. 100,000 rupees, a fortune at the time) to establish the Sarada Ranganathan Endowment for Library Science in 1961.
● He was a "Karma Yogi"—someone who viewed work as worship.

Death
Dr. S.R. Ranganathan passed away on September 27, 1972, in Bangalore, at the age of 80, due to bronchitis.

EPILOGUE: AN ENDURING LEGACY
Why does a librarian born in 1892 matter today?
While we may not use physical card catalogues anymore, Ranganathan’s ideas are alive in the digital world.
1. The Internet: His concept of "Faceted Classification" is the logic behind modern search filters, tags, and metadata on the internet.
2. User Experience: His law, "Save the time of the reader," is the golden rule for Google and Amazon.
3. Public Access: The vast network of public libraries in India exists largely because of his legal battles.

Dr. S.R. Ranganathan found chaos in the world of information and left behind order. He taught the world that librarianship is not just a job; it is a noble science of connecting people with knowledge.
